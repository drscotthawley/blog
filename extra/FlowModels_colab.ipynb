        "In this tutorial post, we provide an accessible introduction to flow-matching and rectified flow models, which are increasingly on the forefront of generative AI applications. Typical descriptions of them are usually laden with extensive probability-math equations, which can form barriers to the dissemination and understanding of these models. Fortunately, before they were couched in probabilities, the mechanisms underlying these models were grounded in basic physics, which provides an alternative and highly-accessible (yet isomorphic) representation of the processes involved. Let's flow."

        "Flow-based generative AI models have been gaining significant traction as alternatives or improvements to traditional diffusion approaches in image and audio synthesis. These models excel at learning optimal trajectories for transforming probability distributions, offering a mathematically elegant framework for data generation. The approach has seen renewed momentum following Black Forest Labs' success with their FLUX models [1], spurring fresh interest in the theoretical foundations laid by earlier work on Rectified Flows [2] in ICLR 2023. Improvements such as [3] have even reached the level of state-of-the-art generative models for one or two-step generation.\n",

While recent expositions [4] have attempted to make these concepts more accessible through probability theory, the underlying physical principles offer a more direct path to understanding.   By returning to the basic physical picture of flows that inspired these generative models, we can build both intuition and deep understanding - insights that may even guide the development of new approaches."

It's more \"expensive\" than forward Euler in that each step requires 4 function evaluations instead of forward Euler's 1 step, and it requires some extra storage, but the advantages you gain in accuracy are seriously worth it (e.g., because you can take much longer steps in time)."

        "\n",
        "How to move on from 2D dots to things like images, text, audio,...etc? We need only consider that the dimensionality of the velocity model is the same as that of the data itself.  Put differently, one can regard the velocity model as supply a tiny \"change\" to the data, whatever form that data is in. And the \"straight line\" trajectory used during training? That's just linear interpolation between the (initially randomly-paired) source data and the target data.  So for images, we will get a \"velocity image\", which will tell us how to change the R,G,B value of every pixel in an image.  This is where U-Nets and Attention come in to play, to compute the \"image-to-image\" task of supplying a \"velocity image\" given an input image distribution (which may just be noise).   For audio, regardless of the representation, the velocity model will tell us how to slightly change the component values in that representation. We then just integrate all the little changes as we did with the dots.\n",

        "Diffusion-models, aka \"score-based models\" are similar to flow models in that the former also learn a vector field (the \"score function\") that serves to differentially transform the points in the sample.  The difference is that flow models are deterministic, whereas diffusion models are constantly injecting fresh noise, as if they are simulating actual brownian motion rather than the macroscopic flow.  To turn our flow model into a diffusion model, we could add \"jitter,\" i.e. inject noise at every step.  The variance of that jitter as a function of time would correspond directly to the \"noise schedule\" of diffusion models.  \n",

This connects nicely with Optimal Transport theory, where the Benamou-Brenier formulation [9] (which has a diffusion-esque equation as on objective) shows that optimal mass transport paths follow constant-velocity geodesics in the Wasserstein metric space. This time-independence property emerges naturally when minimizing transport costs in simple metric spaces, as particles following straight-line paths at constant speeds achieve optimal transport between distributions.\n",

It turns out that, while this would seem to be a nice constraint to satisfy, it is unnecessary for \"getting the job done\" and can limit the expressiveness of the model. Note: Since I'm pushing a \"physics perspective,\" a similar property arises in the phase space flows of Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve area elements ala Liousville's Theorem [10]. The connection between normalizing flows and Hamiltonian systems was applied to generative modeling in the \"Neural Hamiltonian Flows\" paper of ICLR 2020 [11], and continues in a recent NeurIPS 2024 poster-paper [12].[^3] Despite these fascinating connections, the exciting thing about flow-matching and rectified flows is that they seem to be effective even in the absence of the explicit conservation properties of normalizing flows and their relatives, and can thus be implemented quickly and simply.\n",
