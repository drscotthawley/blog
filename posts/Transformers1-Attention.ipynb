    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Attention is All You Need\" (hereafter AIAYN) is the name of the 2017 paper [@aiayn] that introduced Transformer models, a neural network architecture that eventually \"took over\" as the preferred architecture for many machine learning tasks, with models such a BERT and the GPT series (\"#ChatGPT\" - for this blog's SEO) becoming \"foundation\" models upon which further systems continue to be built. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet I found the multiplicity of Transformers' \"moving parts\" to be daunting, and this hindered my numerous, ardent attempts at studying them -- see the References in @sec-references for a list of all the papers, tutorials, and videos I consumed over the years. Many of these treatments do little to reduce the complexity, and thus the simplicity of the original paper's title is often lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is partly because Attention *isn't really* \"all you need,\" and it's a bit of a joke to pair the title with such a complex model diagram like the one shown in the GIF image above.  However, I've come to see the Attention mechanism as the *key piece*, the *central mechanism*, for which everything else is (pretty much) just an add-on. \n",

    "\n",
    "I liken this to rocketry: whether you're talking about model rockets or Saturn Vs, the essential part is the engine that uses a chemical reaction to produce thrust, yet you still need to add on stabilizing fins and a cone for aerodynamics, etc. And if you *really* want to lift heavy payloads then you'll need all kinds of auxiliary systems to regulate fuel flow and control systems for stability. But if you want to understand a Saturn V (I don't, but I'd imagine...) you wouldn't start by listing all the different systems and go over them one by one, rather you'd start from the basic idea and then go into why these other pieces were added on. Such is how I'm recommending that we approach Transformer models.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Things finally \"clicked\" for me this summer --  years later! What finally helped was watching Andrej Karpathy's excellent YouTube tutorial [@andrej_karpathy_lets_2023] for the *second time*, when I noticed he homed in on the Attention part of the model and explained it as being a *weighted average of words.* \n",
    "I believe that if you grasp that central part, then all the other parts of the Transformer can be regarded as \"bells and whistles\" that help it work better. \n",

    "### What is Softmax?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytbYRIN0N4g) is a normalized element-wise exponential function that operates on a vector (i.e. an array) of data $\\vec{x}$ by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\rm softmax}(\\vec{x})_i = {e^{x_i}  \\over \\sum_i e^{x_i}} $$\n",
    "where $x_i$ are the individual elements (i.e., components) of $\\vec{x}$. Usually one sees softmax used as the final output of a classifier or recommendation system, and indeed the final stage of the Transformer's *Decoder* is a softmax function. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Why* is softmax appearing in the Attention calculation? Well, we *could* use something else, but softmax is a great choice! ;-) What we need for our attention weights is a set of positive numbers that add up to 1 (what I call \"parts of a whole\" and what mathematicians call a \"[probability] distribution\"). Usually the $x_i$ values can be positive or negative, so we need *some* function to map from sets of arbitrary real numbers to our weights that are \"parts of a whole.\" (Mathematicians call such functions \"distribution-generating functions.\") We could\n",
    " choose some other function instead of softmax to do the job we need -- say, something monotonic and positive like a sigmoid function -- but softmax is arguably the best choice for a distribution generator because...\n",

    "## What are Q, K, & V?\n",
    "\n",
    "Literally, these stand for \"Query,\" \"Key,\" and \"Value,\" respectively. We already mentioned the value $V$ as the \"inputs\" that are being attended.  Note: these \"inputs\" could be actual data points, or just the outputs from a previous layer in the (stacked) Transformer architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Query\" and \"Key\" are typically described in terms of search algorithms, with $Q$ being \"what am I looking for?\" and $K$ being, say, the keywords or metadata associated with the \"actual\" value $V$. For example, if you're searching on YouTube for videos, you're not searching the *videos themselves*, you're searching over metadata/\"keys\" *about* those videos, and then the *values* of the actual, corresponding videos are served up. \n",
    "\n",

    "In the simplest implementations $K$ is exactly the same as $V$. Like, literally $K$=$V$ can work in many cases. We're not going to do that, but just to say, it can be done. Instead we'll say that $K$ is an \"alternate reduced-dimensional embedding of the embedding of $V$,\" meaning that typically $Q, K,$ and $V$ are usually not the vectors *themselves* but rather the result of a remapping by a (typically) single-layer neural network which adds a little extra expressiveness to the model and which could also be used to project these vectors into some new space with a different (reduced) number of dimensions which is called $d_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing: we've been saying \"vectors\" but technically $Q, K,$ and $V$ are *matrices* consisting of multiple vectors stacked up in rows to form a \"batch\" that allows us to take advantage of the parallel-processing capabilities of GPUs.

Another way of saying is that we take the \"dot product\" of $\\Delta$ with itself, $\\vec{\\Delta} \\cdot \\vec{\\Delta}$ which in matrix form would be $\\Delta$ times its transpose, ie. $\\Delta\\,\\Delta^T$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is \"okay,\" and there's nothing inherently wrong with this measure, but for very high-dimensional spaces it can be tricky to make work well (e.g., it can require extra tweaking to get the scaling right) since most points end up both super-far away from each other and yet (paradoxically?) also distributed around near the surface of a hypersphere. 🤷‍♂️ If what I just wrote didn't resonate with you, just shrug like that emoji-man and read on."

Notice that this only considers the *directions* of $Q$ and $K$ and ignores their magnitudes $|Q|$ and $|K|$. It's as if we're treating $Q$ and $K$ like they were *unit* vectors (which is often fine or at least \"good enough\").
